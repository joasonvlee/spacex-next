`spacex-next` is a Firefox addon that displays data about the next SpaceX launch.

## About

`spacex-next` is a Firefox addon that displays data about the next SpaceX launch, created with [web-ext](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-ext). The extension uses a popup window showing you the time until the next launch and some extra stats. All the data is fetched using the [SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) and gets updated over time. This web extension is not made or designed by the company SpaceX and is meant to help you keep track of the launches.
